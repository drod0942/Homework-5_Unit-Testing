Problem 6
  While we did not use generative AI, there are many ways that it could aid the testing of our app.
  One use of generative AI would be to generate test cases to cover a wide variety of scenarios that humans would miss.  For example, it can efficiently create a large number of examples to be tested or used as data for the tests.  This saves a lot of time for the developers of the app.
  It could also be used to suggest edits to previously developed test for an app.  It could inform the developer of any scenarios they did not cover in their tests, any syntax or logical issues in the code, or any unintended outcomes from the code.
  In addition, it can run tests to check the efficiency and overall success of the app.  It could replace other softwares to do accessibility and usability testing.
It could also test the security level of the app and any faults there might be in the current security measures.
  These are some examples of ways that generative AI could aid the testing of our music rating app.
